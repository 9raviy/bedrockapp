# Environment-Specific Configuration Implementation - Summary

## üéØ What We've Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Created Environment-Specific Configuration System

1. **Environment Config Files**
   - `config/environments/dev.json` - Development environment settings
   - `config/environments/prod.json` - Production environment settings

2. **Configuration Structure**
   ```json
   {
     "projectName": "bedrock-quiz",
     "environment": "dev|prod",
     "domain": {
       "domainName": "hexmi.com",
       "subdomainName": "dev-quiz|quiz",
       "customUrl": "https://dev-quiz.hexmi.com|https://quiz.hexmi.com"
     },
     "backend": {
       "timeout": 30|15,
       "memory": 256|128,
       "environment": {
         "LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG|INFO"
       }
     },
     "infrastructure": {
       "stackName": "bedrock-quiz-dev-stack|bedrock-quiz-prod-stack"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions Workflows**
   - `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml` - Triggers on `develop` branch
   - `.github/workflows/deploy-lambda.yml` - Triggers on `main` branch
   - Both load environment-specific configs and deploy accordingly

4. **Utility Scripts**
   - `config/validate-config.js` - Validates environment configurations
   - `deploy-local.js` - Local deployment script for testing
   - `monitor-workflows.js` - Monitor GitHub Actions workflow status

## üöÄ Current Deployment Status

### Triggered Workflows:
1. **Development Environment** (develop branch push)
   - Deploys to: `https://dev-quiz.hexmi.com`
   - Stack: `bedrock-quiz-dev-stack`
   - Higher memory (256MB), longer timeout (30s), DEBUG logging

2. **Production Environment** (main branch push)
   - Deploys to: `https://quiz.hexmi.com`
   - Stack: `bedrock-quiz-prod-stack`
   - Optimized resources (128MB), shorter timeout (15s), INFO logging

## üìä Monitor Deployment Progress

Visit: https://github.com/9raviy/bedrockapp/actions

Expected workflow runs:
- "Deploy to Development Environment" (from develop branch push)
- "Deploy to Production Environment" (from main branch push)

## üß™ Testing the Environments

### Development Environment:
- URL: https://dev-quiz.hexmi.com
- Features: Higher resources, debug logging, separate stack

### Production Environment:
- URL: https://quiz.hexmi.com (should already be working)
- Features: Optimized resources, info logging, production stack

## üìã Key Differences Between Environments

| Feature | Development | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Domain | dev-quiz.hexmi.com | quiz.hexmi.com |
| Lambda Memory | 256MB | 128MB |
| Lambda Timeout | 30s | 15s |
| Log Level | DEBUG | INFO |
| Stack Name | bedrock-quiz-dev-stack | bedrock-quiz-prod-stack |
| Cache Headers | Short-lived | Long-lived |

## üîÑ Workflow Triggers

- **Development**: Push to `develop` branch
- **Production**: Push to `main` branch
- **Manual**: Both workflows support `workflow_dispatch` for manual triggering

## üéâ Next Steps

1. **Monitor Deployments**: Check GitHub Actions for workflow completion
2. **Test Both Environments**: Verify both URLs work correctly
3. **Validate Differences**: Confirm dev has debug logging, different resources
4. **Future Enhancements**: 
   - Add staging environment
   - Feature branch deployments
   - Automated testing in workflows
   - Environment promotion pipelines

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

Use the local deployment script for testing:
```bash
# Deploy to development locally
node deploy-local.js dev

# Deploy to production locally  
node deploy-local.js prod

# Skip SSL deployment (for faster testing)
node deploy-local.js dev --skip-ssl
```

## ‚úÖ Configuration Validation

Run validation to ensure configs are correct:
```bash
cd config
node validate-config.js
```

The environment-specific configuration system is now fully implemented and both workflows should be deploying to their respective environments!
